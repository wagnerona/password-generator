# Password generator week 6 challenge

Fore this challenge I need to create an application that allows a user to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. I will be using starter code as a base and modifying it to fit the requirements. The application will run in a browser, featuring dynamic updates to the HTML and CSS, which will be powered by JavaScript code that I will write. The user interface will be clean and polished, and will be responsive to different screen sizes.

## Pseudo code (initial)

---

Once button is clicked

- prompt user length of password between 10 and 64

  - Validate answer

Character types

- Prompt user character types (yes or no)
- Prompt user lowercase (yes or no)
- prompt user numeric numbers (yes no)
- Prompt user special characters (yes no)
  - Validate answers
- Validate that at least one character type is selected

Show answer in password box

---

_I soon learned that this Pseudo code was not going to work, I ended up spending way to much time finding out what functions needed to be where. In the future I really have to prioritize this so that making the code does not take as long and I can always look back to the pseudoCode._

## Usage

## Credits and useful info

I heavily relied on research for this challenge, amongst many the top ones were these:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

https://www.w3schools.com/

Some useful things to point out is that I was using open AI to help me understand concepts. A person in class pointed out they could use this and then debug, however I found this extremely confusing as some of the methods use were unknown to me and I was spending more time researching them rather than working on the code. Instead I used it to ask specific questions and consolidate parts of code. Overall this is a very good tool as long as I understand what is given to me.
